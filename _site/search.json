To find your answer quickly on the Answers tab, we recommend you:\n\nUse the control-F function to search for a keyword\nBrowse the right side navigation bar for customer questions\n\nFrequently used links\n\nPreferred Contractor Network: https://www.mnashp.org/preferred-contractor-network-homeowners\nFAQ: https://www.mnashp.org/homeownerfaq\nCost of Heat Comparison: https://www.mnashp.org/cost-of-heat-comparison\nIncentives and Financing: https://www.mnashp.org/incentives-financing\n\n\n\nWhy should I get a minisplit if I have a natural gas boiler?\nThere are three main reasons for installing minisplits if you have a natural gas boiler:\n\nThe first is cooling. A minisplit will provide much more efficient, quiet, and steady cooling than window AC’s.\nThe second is to cut emissions. A heat pump is significantly greener than a boiler over the lifespan of the equipment. Even using the heat pump into mild winter weather only will cut overall emissions.\nThe third is to extend the lifespan of your boiler. Traditional systems like boilers can sometimes cycle on and off during cool spring and fall weather. This strains the equipment. By contrast, minisplits typically excel at providing heat during cool spring and fall weather.\n\n\n\nCan I set my thermostat back with a heat pump?\nYes, you can set your thermostat back for periods of time with a heat pump. Heat pumps operate best when maintaining the same temperature for long periods of time. Setbacks within a few degrees have negligible effects on the heat pump’s efficiency. This can be an option if like your house cooler at night and still want to maintain good energy efficiency.\nAn exception is if you are away from home for a few days or more. A larger setback will still save energy with a heat pump in these cases.\n\n\nCan I do setbacks with a heat pump?\n\nHeat pumps operate best when maintaining the same temperature.\nSetbacks within a few degrees have negligible effects on the heat pump’s efficiency.\nLarger setbacks can save energy if you are gone for days.\n\n\n\nWhat heat pump size should I choose?\nHeat pumps come in sizes as measured by tons. The more tons a heat pump has, the more heating and cooling it can supply. However, more tons are not always better. The right sized heat pump for your home will do a better job keeping you comfortable at the lowest operational costs.\nA larger sized heat pump may make sense if you have:\n\nA large home\nA home that is not well insulated or air-sealed\nA goal to use your heat pump for as much heating as possible\n\nA smaller sized heat pump may make sense if you have:\n\nA smaller home\nA home that is well insulated and air-sealed\n\n\n\nWhich contractor should I work with?\nGetting a quote from a few quality contractors is the best way to get heat pump solutions for your home. Visit our Preferred Contractor Network to connect with a qualified contractor in your area.\n\n\nWhich contractor should I talk to about AWHPs?\nThank you for your question. We unfortunately don’t have specific recommendations of companies who offer air-to-water heat pump installations. We recommend checking with the following sources for quotes or leads:\n\nA geothermal contractor\nA contractor who does both heating and plumbing\nYour local utility- some have contractor networks for customer referrals\nIf you have a specific air-to-water heat pump model in mind, ask that manufacturer for their recommendations of local installers"
