# Can I set my thermostat back with a heat pump?

Yes, you can set your thermostat back for periods of time with a heat pump. Heat pumps operate best when maintaining the same temperature for long periods of time. Setbacks within a few degrees have negligible effects on the heat pump's efficiency. This can be an option if like your house cooler at night and still want to maintain good energy efficiency.  

An exception is if you are away from home for a few days or more. A larger setback will still save energy with a heat pump in these cases.
