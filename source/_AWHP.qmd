# Which contractor should I talk to about AWHPs?

Thank you for your question. We unfortunately don't have specific recommendations of companies who offer air-to-water heat pump installations. We recommend checking with the following sources for quotes or leads:

1. A geothermal contractor

2. A contractor who does both heating and plumbing

3. Your local utility- some have contractor networks for customer referrals

4. If you have a specific air-to-water heat pump model in mind, ask that manufacturer for their recommendations of local installers
